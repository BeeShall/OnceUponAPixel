                <p>It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old
                fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there
                much better worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised
                city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion
                to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows
                the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence.

                To the conglomerate and trachyte
                succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in layers full of bubbles,
                the latter forming regular prisms, placed like a colonnade
                supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable specimen
                of natural architecture. Between the blocks of basalt wound long
                streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous rays;
                and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur.

                I
                did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than
                if I had stood under the shade of a mountain. As it approached nearer
                over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the
                bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the
                sea below. I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore,
                and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less
                than an English mile distance.

                He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
                did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him,
                and brought none. Where could he be? They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
                weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him
                on the stairs.
